This React application, named MovieLand, is a movie search platform that interacts with the OMDb API to fetch movie data based on user input. Key functionalities include:

**Movie Search Feature:** Users can search for movies by typing a title in the search input. The app queries the OMDb API using the movie title and displays matching results.

**Dynamic Movie Display:** After searching, the app either shows a list of movie cards if results are found or displays a "No Movies found" message if there are no matches.

**Initial Display:** On loading, the app automatically displays movies related to the keyword "Batman" as a default.

**Responsive Search:** The app uses an input field for typing a movie title and an interactive search button to trigger a search. Results are updated based on the current search term entered by the user.

**Movie Cards:** Each movie result is displayed as a card, using a separate MovieCard component, allowing for neat and organized display of the movie data.

**Note:** I created this MovieLand application by following a YouTuber channel called JavaScript Mastery, who guided me step by step through the process.
